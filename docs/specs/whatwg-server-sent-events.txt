9.2.1 Introduction

  
This section is non-normative.

  
To enable servers to push data to web pages over HTTP or using dedicated server-push protocols,
  this specification introduces the EventSource interface.

  
Using this API consists of creating an EventSource object and registering an event
  listener.

  
var source = new EventSource('updates.cgi');
source.onmessage = function (event) {
  alert(event.data);
};

  
On the server-side, the script ("updates.cgi" in this case) sends
  messages in the following form, with the text/event-stream MIME type:

  
data: This is the first message.

data: This is the second message, it
data: has two lines.

data: This is the third message.

  

  
Authors can separate events by using different event types. Here is a stream that has two event
  types, "add" and "remove":

  
event: add
data: 73857293

event: remove
data: 2153

event: add
data: 113411

  
The script to handle such a stream would look like this (where addHandler
  and removeHandler are functions that take one argument, the event):

  
var source = new EventSource('updates.cgi');
source.addEventListener('add', addHandler, false);
source.addEventListener('remove', removeHandler, false);

  
The default event type is "message".

  
Event streams are always decoded as UTF-8. There is no way to specify another character
  encoding.

  

  
Event stream requests can be redirected using HTTP 301 and 307 redirects as with normal HTTP
  requests. Clients will reconnect if the connection is closed; a client can be told to stop
  reconnecting using the HTTP 204 No Content response code.

  
Using this API rather than emulating it using XMLHttpRequest or an
  iframe allows the user agent to make better use of network resources in cases where
  the user agent implementer and the network operator are able to coordinate in advance. Amongst
  other benefits, this can result in significant savings in battery life on portable devices. This
  is discussed further in the section below on connectionless
  push.

A reconnection time, in
   milliseconds. This must initially be an implementation-defined value, probably in
   the region of a few seconds.

A last event ID string. This must
   initially be the empty string.

  
Apart from url these are not currently exposed on
  the EventSource object.

Returns the state of this EventSource object's connection. It can have the
    values described below.

   

  

  

  
The EventSource(url, eventSourceInitDict)
  constructor, when invoked, must run these steps:

  

Let ev be a new EventSource object.

Let settings be ev's relevant settings object.

   

Let urlRecord be the result of encoding-parsing a URL given
   url, relative to settings.

If urlRecord is failure, then throw a "SyntaxError"
   DOMException.

Set ev's url to
   urlRecord.

   

Let corsAttributeState be Anonymous.

If the value of eventSourceInitDict's withCredentials member is true, then set
   corsAttributeState to Use
   Credentials and set ev's withCredentials attribute to true.

Let request be the result of creating a potential-CORS request given
   urlRecord, the empty string, and corsAttributeState.

Set request's client to
   settings.

User agents may set (`Accept`, `text/event-stream`) in request's
   header list.

Set request's cache mode to
   "no-store".

Set request's initiator
   type to "other".

Set ev's request to
   request.

Let processEventSourceEndOfBody given response res be the following step: if
   res is not a network error, then reestablish the
   connection.

    
Fetch request, with processResponseEndOfBody set to
    processEventSourceEndOfBody and processResponse set
    to the following steps given response
    res:

    

If res is an aborted network error, then fail the
     connection.

Otherwise, if res is a network error, then reestablish
     the connection, unless the user agent knows that to be futile, in which case the user
     agent may fail the connection.

Otherwise, if res's status is
     not 200, or if res's `Content-Type` is not
     `text/event-stream`, then fail the connection.

     

Otherwise, announce the connection and interpret res's body line by line.
   

Return ev.
  

  

  

  
The url
  attribute's getter must return the serialization of
  this EventSource object's url.

  

  

  
The withCredentials attribute must return the
  value to which it was last initialized. When the object is created, it must be initialized to
  false.

  

  
The readyState attribute represents the state of the
  connection. It can have the following values:

  

  
CONNECTING (numeric value 0)
The connection has not yet been established, or it was closed and the user agent is
   reconnecting.
OPEN (numeric value 1)
The user agent has an open connection and is dispatching events as it receives them.
CLOSED (numeric value 2)
The connection is not open, and the user agent is not trying to reconnect. Either there was a
   fatal error or the close() method was invoked.

  

  

  
When the object is created, its readyState must
  be set to CONNECTING (0). The rules given below
  for handling the connection define when the value changes.

  

  

  
The close()
  method must abort any instances of the fetch algorithm started
  for this EventSource object, and must set the readyState attribute to CLOSED.
 
  

  

  
The following are the event handlers (and their corresponding event handler event types) that must be supported,
  as event handler IDL attributes, by all objects implementing the
  EventSource interface:

9.2.3 Processing model

  

  
When a user agent is to announce the connection, the user agent must queue a
  task which, if the readyState attribute is
  set to a value other than CLOSED, sets the readyState attribute to OPEN and fires an
  event named open at the EventSource
  object.

  

  

  
When a user agent is to reestablish the connection, the user agent must run the
  following steps. These steps are run in parallel, not as part of a task. (The tasks that it queues, of course, are run like normal tasks
  and not themselves in parallel.)

  

    
Queue a task to run the following steps:

    

If the readyState attribute is set to
     CLOSED, abort the task.

Set the readyState attribute to CONNECTING.

Fire an event named error at the EventSource object.
   

Wait a delay equal to the reconnection time of the event source.

Optionally, wait some more. In particular, if the previous attempt failed, then user
   agents might introduce an exponential backoff delay to avoid overloading a potentially already
   overloaded server. Alternatively, if the operating system has reported that there is no network
   connectivity, user agents might wait for the operating system to announce that the network
   connection has returned before retrying.

Wait until the aforementioned task has run, if it has not yet run.

    
Queue a task to run the following steps:

    

If the EventSource object's readyState attribute is not set to CONNECTING, then return.

Let request be the EventSource object's request.

     

      
If the EventSource object's last event ID string is not the empty
      string, then:

      

Let lastEventIDValue be the EventSource object's last event ID string, encoded as UTF-8.

Set (`Last-Event-ID`,
       lastEventIDValue) in request's header list.
     

Fetch request and process the
     response obtained in this fashion, if any, as described earlier in this section.
   
  

  

  
When a user agent is to fail the connection, the user agent must queue a
  task which, if the readyState attribute is
  set to a value other than CLOSED, sets the readyState attribute to CLOSED and fires an
  event named error at the EventSource object.
  Once the user agent has failed the connection,
  it does not attempt to reconnect.

  

  

  
The task source for any tasks that are queued by EventSource objects is the remote event
  task source.

  

  
9.2.4 The `Last-Event-ID` header

  
The Last-Event-ID` HTTP request header reports an
  EventSource object's last event ID
  string to the server when the user agent is to reestablish the connection.

  
See whatwg/html issue
  #7363 to define the value space better. It is essentially any UTF-8 encoded string, that does
  not contain U+0000 NULL, U+000A LF, or U+000D CR.

  
9.2.5 Parsing an event stream

  

  
This event stream format's MIME type is text/event-stream.

  
The event stream format is as described by the stream production of the
  following ABNF, the character set for which is Unicode. [ABNF]

  
stream        = [ bom ] *event
event         = *( comment / field ) end-of-line
comment       = colon *any-char end-of-line
field         = 1*name-char [ colon [ space ] *any-char ] end-of-line
end-of-line   = ( cr lf / cr / lf )

; characters
lf            = %x000A ; U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
cr            = %x000D ; U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)
space         = %x0020 ; U+0020 SPACE
colon         = %x003A ; U+003A COLON (:)
bom           = %xFEFF ; U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK
name-char     = %x0000-0009 / %x000B-000C / %x000E-0039 / %x003B-10FFFF
                ; a scalar value other than U+000A LINE FEED (LF), U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR), or U+003A COLON (:)
any-char      = %x0000-0009 / %x000B-000C / %x000E-10FFFF
                ; a scalar value other than U+000A LINE FEED (LF) or U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)

  
Event streams in this format must always be encoded as UTF-8. [ENCODING]

  
Lines must be separated by either a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED (CRLF) character
  pair, a single U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character, or a single U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)
  character.

  
Since connections established to remote servers for such resources are expected to be
  long-lived, UAs should ensure that appropriate buffering is used. In particular, while line
  buffering with lines are defined to end with a single U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character is safe,
  block buffering or line buffering with different expected line endings can cause delays in event
  dispatch.

  

  
9.2.6 Interpreting an event stream

  
Streams must be decoded using the UTF-8 decode algorithm.

  
The UTF-8 decode algorithm strips one leading UTF-8 Byte Order Mark
  (BOM), if any.

  
The stream must then be parsed by reading everything line by line, with a U+000D CARRIAGE
  RETURN U+000A LINE FEED (CRLF) character pair, a single U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character not
  preceded by a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) character, and a single U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)
  character not followed by a U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character being the ways in which a line can
  end.

  

  
When a stream is parsed, a data buffer, an event type
  buffer, and a last event ID buffer must be associated with it. They must be
  initialized to the empty string.

  

  
Lines must be processed, in the order they are received, as follows:

  
If the line is empty (a blank line)

Dispatch the event, as defined below.
If the line starts with a U+003A COLON character (:)

Ignore the line.
If the line contains a U+003A COLON character (:)

    
Collect the characters on the line before the first U+003A COLON character (:), and let field be that string.

    
Collect the characters on the line after the first U+003A COLON character (:), and let value be that string. If value starts with a U+0020 SPACE
    character, remove it from value.

    
Process the field using the steps described below, using field as the field name and value as the field value.

   
Otherwise, the string is not empty but does not contain a U+003A COLON character (:)

    
Process the field using the steps described below, using the
    whole line as the field name, and the empty string as the field value.

   
  

  
Once the end of the file is reached, any pending data must be discarded. (If the file ends in
  the middle of an event, before the final empty line, the incomplete event is not dispatched.)

  

  

  
The steps to process the field given a field name and a
  field value depend on the field name, as given in the following list. Field names must be compared
  literally, with no case folding performed.

  
If the field name is "event"

Set the event type buffer to the field value.
If the field name is "data"

Append the field value to the data buffer, then append a single U+000A
   LINE FEED (LF) character to the data buffer.
If the field name is "id"

If the field value does not contain U+0000 NULL, then set the last event ID
   buffer to the field value. Otherwise, ignore the field.
If the field name is "retry"

If the field value consists of only ASCII digits, then interpret the field
   value as an integer in base ten, and set the event stream's reconnection time to that integer.
   Otherwise, ignore the field.
Otherwise

The field is ignored.
  

  

  
When the user agent is required to dispatch the
  event, the user agent must process the data buffer, the event type buffer, and the last event ID buffer using steps
  appropriate for the user agent.

  

  

  
For web browsers, the appropriate steps to dispatch the event are as follows:

  

Set the last event ID string of
   the event source to the value of the last event ID buffer. The buffer does
   not get reset, so the last event ID
   string of the event source remains set to this value until the next time it is set by the
   server.

If the data buffer is an empty string, set the data buffer and the event type buffer to the empty string and
   return.

If the data buffer's last character is a U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
   character, then remove the last character from the data buffer.

Let event be the result of creating an event using
   MessageEvent, in the relevant realm of
   the EventSource object.

Initialize event's type attribute to
   "message", its data attribute to data, its origin attribute to the serialization of the origin of the
   event stream's final URL (i.e., the URL after redirects), and its lastEventId attribute to the last event ID string of the event
   source.

If the event type buffer has a value other than the empty string, change the
   type of the newly created event to equal the value of
   the event type buffer.

Set the data buffer and the event type buffer to
   the empty string.

Queue a task which, if the readyState attribute is set to a value other than CLOSED, dispatches the newly created event at the
   EventSource object.

  
If an event doesn't have an "id" field, but an earlier event did set the event
  source's last event ID string, then the
  event's lastEventId field will be set to the
  value of whatever the last seen "id" field was.

  

  

  
For other user agents, the appropriate steps to dispatch the event are
  implementation dependent, but at a minimum they must set the data and event type buffers to the empty string before returning.

  

  

  

  

   
The following event stream, once followed by a blank line:

   
data: YHOO
data: +2
data: 10

   
...would cause an event message with the interface
   MessageEvent to be dispatched on the EventSource object. The event's
   data attribute would contain the string "YHOO\n+2\n10" (where "\n" represents a newline).

   
This could be used as follows:
   
var stocks = new EventSource("https://stocks.example.com/ticker.php");
stocks.onmessage = function (event) {
  var data = event.data.split('\n');
  updateStocks(data[0], data[1], data[2]);
};

   
...where updateStocks() is a function defined as:

   
function updateStocks(symbol, delta, value) { ... }

   
...or some such.

  

  

   
The following stream contains four blocks. The first block has just a comment, and will fire
   nothing. The second block has two fields with names "data" and "id" respectively; an event will
   be fired for this block, with the data "first event", and will then set the last event ID to "1"
   so that if the connection died between this block and the next, the server would be sent a
   `Last-Event-ID` header with the value `1`. The third block
   fires an event with data "second event", and also has an "id" field, this time with no value,
   which resets the last event ID to the empty string (meaning no `Last-Event-ID`
   header will now be sent in the event of a reconnection being attempted). Finally, the last block
   just fires an event with the data " third event" (with a single leading space
   character). Note that the last still has to end with a blank line, the end of the stream is not
   enough to trigger the dispatch of the last event.

   
: test stream

data: first event
id: 1

data:second event
id

data:  third event

  

  

   
The following stream fires two events:

   
data

data
data

data:

   
The first block fires events with the data set to the empty string, as would the last block if
   it was followed by a blank line. The middle block fires an event with the data set to a single
   newline character. The last block is discarded because it is not followed by a blank line.

  

  

   
The following stream fires two identical events:

   
data:test

data: test

   
This is because the space after the colon is ignored if present.

  

  
9.2.7 Authoring notes

  
Legacy proxy servers are known to, in certain cases, drop HTTP connections after a short
  timeout. To protect against such proxy servers, authors can include a comment line (one starting
  with a ':' character) every 15 seconds or so.

  
Authors wishing to relate event source connections to each other or to specific documents
  previously served might find that relying on IP addresses doesn't work, as individual clients can
  have multiple IP addresses (due to having multiple proxy servers) and individual IP addresses can
  have multiple clients (due to sharing a proxy server). It is better to include a unique identifier
  in the document when it is served and then pass that identifier as part of the URL when the
  connection is established.

  
Authors are also cautioned that HTTP chunking can have unexpected negative effects on the
  reliability of this protocol, in particular if the chunking is done by a different layer unaware
  of the timing requirements. If this is a problem, chunking can be disabled for serving event
  streams.
 

  
Clients that support HTTP's per-server connection limitation might run into trouble when
  opening multiple pages from a site if each page has an EventSource to the same
  domain. Authors can avoid this using the relatively complex mechanism of using unique domain names
  per connection, or by allowing the user to enable or disable the EventSource
  functionality on a per-page basis, or by sharing a single EventSource object using a
  shared worker.

  

  
9.2.8 Connectionless push and other features

  
User agents running in controlled environments, e.g. browsers on mobile handsets tied to
  specific carriers, may offload the management of the connection to a proxy on the network. In such
  a situation, the user agent for the purposes of conformance is considered to include both the
  handset software and the network proxy.

  

   
For example, a browser on a mobile device, after having established a connection, might detect
   that it is on a supporting network and request that a proxy server on the network take over the
   management of the connection. The timeline for such a situation might be as follows:

   
Browser connects to a remote HTTP server and requests the resource specified by the author
    in the EventSource constructor.
The server sends occasional messages.
In between two messages, the browser detects that it is idle except for the network activity
    involved in keeping the TCP connection alive, and decides to switch to sleep mode to save
    power.
The browser disconnects from the server.
The browser contacts a service on the network, and requests that the service, a "push
    proxy", maintain the connection instead.
The "push proxy" service contacts the remote HTTP server and requests the resource specified
    by the author in the EventSource constructor (possibly
    including a `Last-Event-ID` HTTP header, etc.).
The browser allows the mobile device to go to sleep.
The server sends another message.
The "push proxy" service uses a technology such as OMA push to convey the event to the
    mobile device, which wakes only enough to process the event and then returns to sleep.

  

  
This can reduce the total data usage, and can therefore result in considerable power
  savings.

  
As well as implementing the existing API and text/event-stream wire format as
  defined by this specification and in more distributed ways as described above, formats of event
  framing defined by other applicable specifications may be supported. This
  specification does not define how they are to be parsed or processed.

  
9.2.9 Garbage collection

  
While an EventSource object's readyState is CONNECTING, and the object has one or more event
  listeners registered for open, message, or error events, there must
  be a strong reference from the Window or WorkerGlobalScope object that
  the EventSource object's constructor was invoked from to the EventSource
  object itself.

  
While an EventSource object's readyState is OPEN, and the object has one or more event listeners
  registered for message or error events, there must be a strong reference from the
  Window or WorkerGlobalScope object that the EventSource
  object's constructor was invoked from to the EventSource object itself.

  
While there is a task queued by an EventSource object on the remote event
  task source, there must be a strong reference from the Window or
  WorkerGlobalScope object that the EventSource object's constructor was
  invoked from to that EventSource object.

  

  
If a user agent is to forcibly close an
  EventSource object (this happens when a Document object goes away
  permanently), the user agent must abort any instances of the fetch algorithm started for this EventSource object,
  and must set the readyState attribute to CLOSED.
 
  

  

  
If an EventSource object is garbage collected while its connection is still open,
  the user agent must abort any instance of the fetch algorithm
  opened by this EventSource.
 
  

  
9.2.10 Implementation advice

  
This section is non-normative.

  
User agents are strongly urged to provide detailed diagnostic information about
  EventSource objects and their related network connections in their development
  consoles, to aid authors in debugging code using this API.

  
For example, a user agent could have a panel displaying all the EventSource
  objects a page has created, each listing the constructor's arguments, whether there was a network
  error, what the CORS status of the connection is and what headers were sent by the client and
  received from the server to lead to that status, the messages that were received and how they were
  parsed, and so forth.

  
Implementations are especially encouraged to report detailed information to their development
  consoles whenever an error event is fired, since little to no
  information can be made available in the events themselves.
